Project Description:

Backup plan is an progressive web app that allows users to connect to others who are searching for temporary housing in the event of a natural disaster.  Users that have been displaced by natural disasters will also have to ability to leave messages detailing their plans and well being for any one who may be concerned for their safety.

Problem Statement:

Every year thousands of people are displaced by natural disasters in the United States alone.  Wildfires, tornados, and flooding can occur at any moment almost any where in the US, causing people to have to relocate in a moments notice.  Often times people have to evacuate before they can make plans, and before they can notify loved ones of their plans.  Backup Plan aims to help displaced peoples locate temporary housing from generous individuals or families, while having the ability to leave messages for friends or family that may be trying to contact them.

User experience:

Users will be able to create an account and profile.  Once an account has been created the users will be able to search the database of people that have extra living space available.  If a user finds a place to stay that they find suitable they will be able to message the owner of the space to set up arrangements.  They will also be able to leave updates on their locattion, well being, or any other information that may be pertienent to the situation.  People who are searching for friends or loved ones will be able to search the databse for specific phone number.  If a matching phone number has been found the app will display messages left by the owner of that phone number.  Users will be able to add a phone number to their "watch list" and recieve push notifactions when ever a new message or update has ben sent out from that account related to the phone number. Being a progressive web app Backup Plan will cahce changes made in the app when no connection is avaiable, and will automatically sync changes when a connection can be established.
